# Brief: Data is powerful once people understand it.
I know what you are thinking... FINALLY! DATA!! Right?! In this brief, you should use your coding skills to visualize data.

## In this brief you should:
* *(Leave feedback on the first two weeks: https://goo.gl/forms/imtDzLeGHMFGZmzr1)*
* Pick any topic you find interesting.
* Create a website on that topic.
* Find and visualize data using a chart (using e.g. Chart.js) on the website.
* Make it available online so that you can share a link to it.

## Bonus: 
* Can you get the data from the API?
* Make it pretty/nice
* Can you make it work on smartphones?

*Deadline: Friday*

* Coding Buddies, 3 people (new ones, I will assign them and send them out during today).
Do a presentation and a code review with your coding buddies. 
Your presentation:
    1. Show off and present what you built
    2. Go through the code and explain how it works and what your biggest struggle was and how you solved it.
* Send me a short version of your presentation:
    1. A link to your project.
    2. What it is.
    3. Short summary how you made it work and was your biggest struggle / how you solved it.
